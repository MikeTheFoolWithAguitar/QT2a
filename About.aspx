    <p>Regulation Solutions, Inc. is a third party administrator of DOT Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs.</br></br>
       In 1991 the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act was passed, requiring DOT Agencies to implement drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees. 49 CFR Part 40 is a DOT-wide regulation that states how to conduct testing and how to return employees to safety-sensitive duties after they violate a DOT drug and alcohol regulation. 49 CFR Part 40 applies to all DOT-required testing, regardless of mode of transportation.</br></br>
       Our clients participate in our programs to satisfy this DOT requirement.</br></br>
       We act as a consortium/third-party administrator in charge of coordinating our client’s testing services. We administer part or all of a client’s required DOT drug and alcohol testing program. Elements of our programs include: Who is subject to the regulations, Service Providers, Collection Facilities, Laboratories, Medical Review Officers, Substance Abuse Professionals, When 
       will testing be conducted (Pre-employment, Random Employee Selection, Reasonable Suspicion, Post-accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up), Which drugs will be tested for, Documentation, Files, Consents, Notifications, Investigations, Reasonable Suspicion and Post Accident documentation. Random employee selection can be by individual company or multiple company driver consortium pool.</br></br>
       Our website allows you to monitor your participation in our programs with forms, reports and training materials including the Driver Qualification File. The Driver Qualification File allows you easily track your DOT compliance at both the company and individual level. </p>
